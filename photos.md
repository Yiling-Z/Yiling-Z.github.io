I hardly take photos though, in this digital world, I still have some photos to share with you in case you never meet me in person.<br>

Some of them are actually my training/validation data. I assure you these images are all natural images.<br>

I better start with a belle photo of my parrot.<br>

<style>
.responsive-img { max-width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block; }
.img-caption { text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #666; }
</style>
