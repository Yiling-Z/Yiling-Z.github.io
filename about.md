Hello, this is **Yiling Zhang**. I was born in **Hangzhou** in 1999. <br>
I am now in Hangzhou doing nothing except for life.<br>
<br>
I recently received my master's degree in mathematics and vision (master MVA) and my engineer's degree in mathematics at École nationale des ponts et chaussées. I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021. In conclusion, I've always been a math student and I was doing **vision** in the master period.<br>
I worked in AI industry in vision and in health care, where I aim to continue.<br>
<br>
I've been writing Chinese modern poems on and off since college, some of my works are available here, others are buried in disks of my ancient devices and on draft papers.<br>
